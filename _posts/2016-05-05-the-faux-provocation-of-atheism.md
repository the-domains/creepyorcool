I'm_an atheist._

_Is that so?_

Awfully good of you to die, find out what exactly does happen post-mortem, rise from that dead (that bit does a sound little familiar...?) and offer us definitive proof as to whether there is a god and afterlife after all.

Sarcasm aside, how _brave _of you to take such a stand! To announce in the Western world in the 21st century that you do not in fact believe in a god. Dare I believe my ears, but you're against organized religions entirely?

The shame you'll bring down on your family! How will you ever show your face in town again once people know about this sordid belief of yours?

Sarcasm truly aside now: no-one cares. No-one has cared in the West for a long time now. It does not make you unique or insightful, it just makes you one of the multitude.

One small caveat though: you certainly could earn an inkling of my respect if you were to travel to the Middle East and expound upon your atheistic leanings there. Risk torture and death in telling Muslims that they are in fact mistaken and there is no god and I'll give you a round of applause on the way to the gallows.

Because let's be honest, when you say you're against religion, you're really saying that you're against Christianity.
