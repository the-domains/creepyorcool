With the Indiana loss last night, and Cruz's withdrawal from the primary race, the next President of the United States will be a big government leftist: Trump, Clinton or Sanders (Clinton in all likelihood barring a miracle).

Undoubtedly many conservatives are upset about how this came about, and frustrated at the short-sightedness and foolishness of many involved in the process, but I find this particularly galling as an Englishman who moved to the United States several years ago.

I met my wife when studying abroad here for a year, and after five years of traveling to see one another and living together for a while in New Zealand, we decided to get married. We discussed where we would both live and we decided that I would come to America. One of the reasons I was more than happy to do so was because the hope of conservatism still existed here.

Being born in England in 1986 I saw first-hand the death of conservatism in my native land. We went from a conservative titan, and an inspirational leader, Margaret Thatcher (even more widely reviled nowadays in England than Reagan is here), to Tony Blair in just seven years. Blair's Britain truly was the end for England.

100 years ago today, despite being embroiled in the Great War, the British Empire was the empire on which the sun never set. Today England is a bitter and desiccated husk of what it once was, jettisoning everything which once made it great and scorning those proudly celebrating the few remaining vestiges of our culture and history.

The excellent [_The Politically Incorrect Guide to the British Empire_ by H.W. Crocker III][0] paraphrases the Life of Brian: "What did the British Empire ever really do for us?" "Apart from roads, railways, ports, schools, a parliamentary system of government, rights, separation of powers, checks and balances, the rule of law, and the English language... nothing!"

There is currently a Conservative Party in power in England---but that is a "large C" Conservative party, and not "small C" conservatism. They could be described as centrist as best, with a few pockets of resistance scattered throughout the party. Despite that, even the English electorate (a more spoilt, self-entitled, ignorant and apathetic group of people you'd struggle to find anywhere in the world) had the common sense to reject the progressivism of Milliband and come over to the semblance of conservatism last election.

I was delighted to come to the States though in the build-up to this election. Obama has been as feckless, dangerous and incompetent as Blair had been for us, and I was certain that the frustrated throughout the country would rally to the cause of Senator Cruz. Even if somehow Cruz lost, I was sure that someone capable would win otherwise: Walker, Paul, Perry, etc. I thought that popular conservatism still had a place in this country, and was something the American people still understood to unfailingly lead towards greater prosperity and liberty for all.

Lo, and behold though! The rise of Trump! Though unwaveringly supported by the mainstream media (who will bury him in the general) and many elements of the conservative media (who we should cease giving any patronage to from now on: Breitbart, Drudge, Fox, etc.), those who voted for Trump will need to look at themselves long and hard in the mirror after Hillary's victory.

You could have elected the closest person we have had to Reagan as the Republican nominee this year, but instead you wanted a strongman. Someone who would _say it like it is_. You wanted an incoherent, bloviated and conceited buffoon who you projected your hopes onto in nothing but an exercise in wish fulfillment. He has done nothing but lie to you, and manipulate those of you ready to buy into his snake oil salesman routine.

Trump cannot win a general election, and even if he could, what would you expect from his presidency? A wall would not be built, Obamacare would morph into socialized healthcare, the reach of the federal government would be massively expanded, freedom of speech would be curtailed and the economy would worsen (as bad as it's been) with his idiotic extension of tariffs.

Yes, Trump was a massive beneficiary of open primaries (Cruz would be the nominee already if all Republican primaries were closed), of the odious Kasich playing the spoiler, and the fawning sycophancy of many in the media, but the fault lies with those who voted for him hoping he'd stop immigration, or wishing he'd put a stop to government cronyism, rather than vote for a candidate with a long-term track record of fighting those things, rather than enabling them.

Cruz made some mistakes: buddying up with Trump for so long at the start, the New York values jibe (apt as it may be), striking a deal with Kasich for Indiana, etc. But as the most conservative candidate in the race, espousing the principles I believe in, there was no-one better to become President than he.

There's a good chance that the Senate (not that the GOP did much with it) will be lost be now on the back of anti-Trump ads from the Democrats and Hillary will continue down the road that Obama started on. The Supreme Court will be packed with progressive leftists intent on further bending and misconstruing the Constitution, and this country will drift further and further from the ideals it was founded upon.

As bad as Trump losing and the aforementioned will be, the thing I fear above all is Trump forever tarring the name of conservatism with his candidacy. Trump is not a conservative, he does not hold conservative positions, and I can only hope that in the aftermath people will come to realize it. As Cruz pointed out, he is the flip side of the coin from Hillary.

I hope this general election doesn't become the end of conservatism as a popular and viable message in this country as happened in England.

Thank you Senator Cruz for fighting the good fight and I pray that you continue to do so in the Senate.

Until 2020\.
